# Welcome to Odin Assignment Management System(AMS)
Odin AMS was created using Flask
## What is Odin AMS?

Odin AMS will leave behind the old paper homework
diaries for secondary schools and sixth forms and instead 
use a web based application where teachers can guarantee
students will have been set their homework and assignments.

## What can Odin AMS do?

Odin AMS will allow teachers to send assignments and homework
via the application, notifying pupils they have a task to complete
The pupils will be able to check off these assignments, so they
can manage what they have and haven't completed. Teachers
will also be allowed to create courses in which students
can enroll on.
